                Birr is a town in County Offaly, Ireland. 
                Between 1620 and 1899 it was called Parsonstown, after the Parsons family who were local 
                landowners and hereditary Earls of Rosse. Birr is a designated Irish Heritage 
                Town with a carefully preserved Georgian heritage. Birr itself has graceful wide streets and 
                elegant buildings. Many of the houses in John's Place and Oxmantown Mall have exquisite 
                fanlight windows of the Georgian period. The town is known for Birr Castle and gardens, 
                home of the Parsons family, and also site of the Leviathan of Parsonstown, 
                the largest telescope in the world for over 70 years, and a large modern radio telescope.

                    Leviathan of Parsonstown, or Rosse six-foot telescope, is a historic reflecting telescope of 72 inches 
                    (1.83 m) aperture, which was the largest telescope in the world from 1845 until the construction of the 
                    100-inch (2.5 m) Hooker Telescope in California in 1917. The Rosse six-foot telescope was built by William 
                    Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse on his estate, Birr Castle, at Parsonstown (now Birr in Ireland)
