                    Birr is a designated Irish Heritage Town due to the preservation and wealth of Georgian architecture in 
                    the town. The earliest Georgian style buildings dating from 1740s are located in Emmet Square and 
                    Emmet street (then known as Cumberland Square and Cumberland Street). The column in the centre of the 
                    square dates from 1747 and was built to carry the statue of the Duke of Cumberland, known as the Bloody 
                    Duke and the victor of the Battle of Culloden. The statue was removed in 1915 as it was in danger of 
                    collapse. The Oxmantown Mall was laid out in the early 19th century and was designed as a promenade 
                    leading from Birr Castle gates to the Church of Ireland.

                    years. The area has been linked with aviation for some time - as a British Army airstrip was previously near 
                    the current field.Birr lies on the N52 and N62 national secondary roads. The routes are combined as they 
                    pass through Birr.
