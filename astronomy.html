                    Lord Rosse was the eldest son of Laurence Michael Harvey Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse, and Anne 
                    (n√©e Messel, mother of Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon by an earlier marriage). 
                    Lord Rosse was educated at Eton College, Aiglon College, University of Grenoble and Christ 
                    Church, Oxford. He was an officer in the Irish Guards from 1955-57 and worked for the United 
                    Nations from 1963-80. He succeeded his father in 1979. He lives at Birr Castle, County Offaly. 
                    From his birth until he succeeded to the earldom in 1979, he was known as Lord Oxmantown.

                    Leviathan of Parsonstown, or Rosse six-foot telescope, is a historic reflecting telescope of 72 inches 
                    (1.83 m) aperture, which was the largest telescope in the world from 1845 until the construction of the 
                    100-inch (2.5 m) Hooker Telescope in California in 1917. The Rosse six-foot telescope was built by

            <h3>First Glimpses of spiral nebulae</h3><br>

                    One of the major discoveries with the telescope was the spiral nature of the nebulae.  
                    The great mirror was the first to be able to see that many of these were spiral in shape. 
                    What Lord Rosse was seeing were in fact galaxies.  The famous M.51 whirlpool galaxy is the 
                    classic example of this and we have commemorated it with a spiral of lime trees which 
                    visitors can walk around.
