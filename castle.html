                    William, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Earl of Rosse was able to build this telescope with the help of his wife Mary's fortune.  
                    It was a great engineering feat because he had to work out the ability to raise and lower the immense tube, 
                    and also to cast the mirror, or speculum, himself.  It took many experiments to find the right combinations 
                    of metal to use for this. The metal was then heated in a furnace in the moat by turf (or peat) from the 
                    bogs which comprised much of his estate. The next problem he had was in cooling the speculum.  
                    The first two mirrors cracked as cooling happened too quickly.  He eventually made two mirrors 
                    which were inter changed and removed for polishing as the damp caused them to mist over.  This in 
                    itself was another engineering feat, and a small railway line was built to transport the massive 
                    mirrors to and from the workshops for polishing.

                    Cross over the enchanting waterfall above the gravity fed fountain in the Victorian Fernery, 
                    or follow the River Walk to the double bridges where the Little Brosna river and Camcor river meet.

                    The gardens are home to an abundance of rare plants, collected by the Earls of Rosse on their travels 
                    around the world over the last 150 years. Within the 50 hectares you will find 50 champion trees, 
                    over 5000 species of plant as well as rivers, lake and waterfalls. It now has plant material collected 
                    and subscribed for by 3 generations of the family, as well as some of the most famous plant hunters, 
                    past and present. It was the first garden in Ireland to receive specimens of Metasequoia glyptostroboides 
                    (Dawn Redwood) after its discovery in China in 1945. Recent plant hunting expeditions by the current Earl 
                    and Countess include Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Iran, South Africa, New Zealand, China and Bhutan.
